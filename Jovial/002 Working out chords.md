# 5 Steps to work out chord from a song/melody

## 1. Find the songs' key

- Easiest way is to look at the note where the melody finishes off. (`C` in ![yt_favicon](https://www.youtube.com/s/desktop/e9a67dcd/img/favicon.ico)  [This old man](https://youtu.be/v0_iIpfdTXw))
- See which notes are used to figure out the scale.
- It tells that the _first_ chord (**tonic chord**?)that the melody starts with is usually the same chord (here `C`) They are not always the case but it works.
- It also tells that **diatonic chords** (chords that are built on the first / tonic chord), in case of `C` its `Dm`, `Em`, `F`, `G` and `Am` & `Bdim` are a possibility to be the first chord.

## 2. Which notes are in respective category

- There are three types of notes
  - Chord Notes
  - Passing Notes
  - Anticipations and Suspensions

- It's easy to get a chord notes to find where the chord sits relative to songs beat (4 beats is good).
- More likely to find chord notes on on-beats (1 & 3) an passing notes on off-beats (2 & 4).
