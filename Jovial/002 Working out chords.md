# 5 Steps to work out chord from a song/melody

## 1. Finding the songs' key [1:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilcfgQ3lZus&t=110s)

- Easiest way is to look at the note where the melody ends. (`C` in case of ![yt_favicon](https://www.youtube.com/s/desktop/e9a67dcd/img/favicon.ico)  [This old man](https://youtu.be/v0_iIpfdTXw)) That note will be *tonic* - *note* that the *key* is named after.

> Major keys have bright sounds, and minor keys have dark sounds.

- "This old man" uses exlusively the notes of `C` scale.
- It also tells that the _first_ chord (**tonic chord**) that the melody starts with is usually the same note that the melody ends with (here `C`).

> That may not always the case but it works most of the time.

- Chances are most of the cord are from the list of **diatonic chords** (chords that are built on the first / *tonic* chord).

> In case of `C` the possibilies are `Dm`, `Em`, `F`, `G` and `Am` & `Bdim`.

- Some of them might be extenstion like `G7` or `FM7`.

## 2. Finding type of chords [4:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilcfgQ3lZus&t=288s)

- There are three types of notes in a melody
  - Chord Notes
  - Passing Notes
  - Anticipations and Suspensions

- It's easy to get a chord notes to find where the chord sits relative to song's beat.

> Lets consider "*This old man*" in the 4 beats. [Listen](https://youtu.be/ilcfgQ3lZus?list=PLpOuhygfD7QmXR6JEBHlScLaQzcu1qjej&t=367).

- In a 4 beat bar, stronger beats are 1 & 3 also called the **on-beats** and weaker notes aka. **off-beats** i.e. 2 & 4.
- We're more likely to find chord notes on on-beats (stressed) and passing notes on off-beats (un-stressed).

- In the linke "*He plays knick knack*", the on-keys are `F` & `A`, hence we can play `F` / `Dm` chord, both of which sounds okay. Following "*on my thumb*" is a rise / tension.
- When there's a tension in the melody, indicating that we're about to return to the first chord, we can drop in a `G7` which kind of pulls us back to a starting chord.

## 3. How chord progressions works [10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilcfgQ3lZus&t=608s)

- The diatonics chords can be numbers so that it's easier when we compare and discuss. Diatonic chords of `C` are `C` `Dm`, `Em`, `F`, `G` and `Am` & `Bdim`. They can be numberd as 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 respectively.
- It's cool to observe that any major-key has the same chord progression pattern: `major, minor x 2, major x 2, minor and diminished` (and so is the case with any minor-key).
- Most progression tend to start & end on the number `1` chord - aka. **tonic** chord (A chord with same name as that of a key).
- The second most important number is `5` chord - aka. **dominant** chord, because it resolves strongly to the tonic. Which means in the key of `C` when we play `G` it wants to drag us back to `C`, the tonic.
- Dominant sevent's chord (e.g. `G7` in the key of `C`) is stronger (than `G` in the key of `C`).
- These tend to appear at the points of maximum tension in a melody.
- The journey from `1` and to `5` chord are very common in chord progressions. (There are execptions to this, but it will work in most cases) They can act as tent poles for the chords.

- There are also pther common combinations of chords (e.g. `2`, `5`, `1` `Dm`, `G`, `C` in the key of `C`).
- Instead of learning all the existing pattern, try to derive them from the melodies that we already know.

## 4. Verify, the derived the chords [16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilcfgQ3lZus&t=961s)

- Use your ear to check if it sounds right. If there are alternetives play them as well.
- Cross check with existing songs. If you're creating your own music, bring out that artistic sense.
- In the first like of "This old man, he plays one", we could be a little more creative by bringing in the `Em` chord right after the tonic, int the 3rd / on-beat. Hence the progression:

```txt
C             Em
This old man, he plays one

F        Dm          G7
He plays knick knack on my thumb, With a
```

## 5. Check for complications and exceptions [17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilcfgQ3lZus&t=1070s)

- The actual chords would be more developed and extended than the basic underlying chord. Eg. `G` was extended to `G7` in "This Old Man".
- To be handle this is, one needs to be really familiar which chord is being played when they hear them. Therefore practice lots of other songs.
