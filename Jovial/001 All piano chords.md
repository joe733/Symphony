### 1.1 How to create thirds

- Thirds are a type of interval on a piano. An interval is a way to measure distance on a piano.
- A **Major Third** is _five (5)_ notes on the piano, including the first one.
- A **Minor Third** is _four (4)_ notes on the piano, including the first one.

| Notes (X) | Minor Third (from X) | Major Third (from X) |
| --------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| C         | D#                   | E                    |
| C#        | E                    | F                    |
| D         | F                    | F#                   |
| D#        | F#                   | G                    |
| E         | G                    | G#                   |
| F         | G#                   | A                    |
| F#        | A                    | Bb                   |
| G         | Bb                   | B                    |
| G#        | B                    | C                    |
| Bb        | C                    | C#                   |
| B         | C#                   | D                    |

### 1.2 How to create chords

- All of the chords (here) are built in root position in their most simple form.
- But we need not stick to that key/note ordering. For example: A chord of C could be _any combination_ of any number (> 1) of's _C's_, _D's_ and _E's_.
- The differnce in ordering of the notes causes voicing and inversions.

## 2. Basic Chords

### 2.1 Simple Major Chords `X, Xm`

- **Simple Major (X)** = Major Third + Minor Third
  - e.g. `C = C[C# D D# E] + E[F F# G] + G = C D G`
- **Simple Minor (Xm)** = Minor Third + Major Third
  - e.g. Cm = `C[C# D D#] + D#[E F F# G] + G = C D# G`

| Key | Major Chord | Minor Chord |
| --- | ----------- | ----------- |
| `C` | `C E G`     | `C Eb G`    |
| `D` | `D F# A`    | `D F A`     |
| `E` | `E G# B`    | `E G B`     |
| `F` | `F A C`     | `F Ab B`    |
| `G` | `G B D`     | `G Bb D`    |
| `A` | `A C# E`    | `A C E`     |
| `B` | `B D# F#`   | `B D F#`    |

### 2.2 The Seventh `X7, Xm7, Xmaj7/XM7`

#### 2.2.1 Dominant-Seventh Chord `X7`

- **Dominant-Seventh Chord (X7)** = Simple Major + Minor Third
  - e.g. `G7 = G[G# A Bb B] + B[C C# D] + D[D# E F] + F = G B D F`

#### 2.2.2 The Major Seventh Chord `Xmaj7` / `XM7`

- **Major-Seventh Chord (XM7)** = Simple Major + Major Third
  - e.g. `Bmaj7 = B[C C# D D#] + D#[E F F#] + F#[G G# A Bb] + Bb = B D# F# Bb`

#### 2.2.3 The Minor Seventh Chord `Xm7`

- **Minor-Seventh Chord (Xm7)** = Simple Minor + Minor Third
  - e.g. `Dm7 = D[D# E F] + F[F# G G# A] + A[Bb B C] + C = D F A C`

| Key | Dominant Seventh | Major Seventh | Minor Seventh |
| --- | ---------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| `C` | `C E G A#`       | `C E G B`     | `C Eb G Bb`   |
| `D` | `D F# A C`       | `D F# A C#`   | `D F A C`     |
| `E` | `E G# B D`       | `E G# B D#`   | `E G B D`     |
| `F` | `F A C D#`       | `F A C E`     | `F Ab B Eb`   |
| `G` | `G B D F`        | `G B D F#`    | `G Bb D F`    |
| `A` | `A C# E G`       | `A C# E G#`   | `A C E G`     |
| `B` | `B D# F# A`      | `B D# F# A#`  | `B D F# A`    |

### 2.3 The Sixth `X6, Xm6`

#### 2.3.1 The Major Sixth Chord `X6`

- **Major Sixth Chord (X6)** = Simple Major + Two Notes
  - e.g. `F6 = F  + A + C[C# D] D = F A C D`

#### 2.3.2 The Minor Sixth Chord `Xm6`

- **Minor Sixth Chord (Xm6)** = Simple Minor + Two Notes
  - e.g. `Em6 = E  + G + B[C C#] C# = E G B C`
