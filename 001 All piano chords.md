### 1.1 How to create Thirds

- Thirds are a type of interval on a piano. An interval is a way to measure distance on a piano.
- A **Major Third** is _five (5)_ notes on the piano, including the first one.
- A **Minor Third** is _four (4)_ notes on the piano, including the first one.

| Notes (X) | Minor Third (from X) | Major Third (from X) |
| --------- | -------------------- | -------------------- |
| C         | D#                   | E                    |
| C#        | E                    | F                    |
| D         | F                    | F#                   |
| D#        | F#                   | G                    |
| E         | G                    | G#                   |
| F         | G#                   | A                    |
| F#        | A                    | Bb                   |
| G         | Bb                   | B                    |
| G#        | B                    | C                    |
| Bb        | C                    | C#                   |
| B         | C#                   | D                    |

### 1.2 How to create basic chords

- A **Basic Major (maj)** is = A Major Third + A Minor Third
  - e.g. Cmaj = C[C# D D# E] + E[F F# G]
- A **Basic Major (min)** is = A Major Third + A Minor Third
  - e.g. Cmin = C[C# D D#] + D#[E F F#]
